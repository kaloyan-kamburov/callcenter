# CRUD Page Pattern (React + MUI + RTK Query)

Use this structure for new CRUD pages to keep behavior and UX consistent with `AdminsPage`.

## Page Composition

- Wrap the page in `PageContainer` and provide a custom `header` slot.
- Keep list content in a full-height `Box` and render `DataGrid` inside it.
- In the header, place a title on the left and a primary "Add <Entity>" button on the right.

## Data + Types

- Use typed RTK Query hooks from feature API slices (for example, `useGet<EntityPlural>Query`).
- Define `GridColDef<Entity>[]` columns with explicit fields and sizing.
- Always provide `getRowId` when rendering `DataGrid`.

## Actions + Modals

- Include an `actions` column with edit/delete icon buttons.
- On edit/delete click: store selected row in local state, then open the matching modal.
- Reuse one modal component for create/edit via a `mode` prop when possible.
- Pass selected entity id/object to edit/delete modals via typed props.

## Internationalization (i18n)

- Do not hardcode visible UI strings in CRUD pages or modals; use translation keys via `t(...)`.
- Add new keys to both `src/locales/en.json` and `src/locales/bg.json` when introducing new labels/messages.
- Localize page headers, primary/add button text, `DataGrid` column headers, modal titles/labels/actions, confirmation text, and toast messages.

## API Conventions

- Keep API base URLs in env vars with a safe fallback in one base API file.
- Register clear `tagTypes` and prefer invalidation/refetch through RTK Query conventions.

## Example Expectations

- New pages should follow the same flow: list -> create modal -> edit modal -> delete confirmation.
- New CRUD pages should match existing naming style for files, hooks, and components.
